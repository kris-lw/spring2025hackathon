KSU Spring 2025 Hackathon || Challenge #2 || Challenge Sponsor: Assurant

Team Members: Lily Riddle, J'adore Jn-Charles, Kristen Lawrence

## Project Description:
For the KSU Spring 2025 Hackathon for Social Good, we have chosen to tackle the Assurant Way Challenge. Our solution seeks to both reflect and reinforce Assurant's primary purpose (i.e., "helping people thrive in a Connected World" the "Assurant Way") by creating an MVP that expounds upon the importance of providing interconnective software and accessible digital resources for minority groups whose technological knowledge and expertise show a negative correlation with the evolution of contemporary systems (e.g., senior citizens, people with disabilities, etc.), as these groups are the most likely to be left behind as society progresses. Our service aims to mitigate the disconnect between our chosen personas--people with physical or psychological impairments, the job agencies willing to hire them, and the government agencies that manage the legal work behind the application and emploment process--by acting as a form of "middle management" to more efficiently facilitate these exchanges (as time appears to be one of the key contributors in rendering equitable workplace opportunity unachievable).

Our solution includes a website (that can be accessed and utilized by all personas), UML and ER diagrams that detail the way our system will be mapped and how our data will be stored and managed, a sequence diagram that demonstrates the ways in which critical functions and operations are executed, a Figma design prototype that experiments with website layouts, themes, etc., and a FigJam board that showcases parts of our team's brainstorming and research phase. The website will feature various accessibility considerations, particularly in the form of streamlining the process by which those in need of aide can access the resources provided by job and government agencies, and vice versa (i.e., agencies having access to essential employee information and documents).
