KSU Spring 2025 Hackathon || Challenge #2 || Challenge Sponsor: Assurant

Team Members: Lily Riddle, J'adore Jn-Charles, Kristen Lawrence

## Project Description:
For the 2025 Hackathon for Social Good, we have chosen to build a solution for the Assurant Way Challenge. Our project works in tandem with the Assurant way to achieve (their //or// our shared) mission to help people thrive by making the Connected World easier and more enjoyable to experience. We have specified our approach around connecting those of less technologically-savvy groups, such as the elderly or the disabled, with government and job agencies in order to better their access to quality-of-life resources and jobs catered to their needs. 

Our solution will entail a website that prioritizes the technologically unsavvy. It will feature various accessibility considerations, particularly in the form of streamlining the process by which those in need of aid can access the resources that provide. This solution is all about enabling the less technically-able to connect in this Connected World.
